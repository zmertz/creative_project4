    description: "Although California was sighted by Spanish navigator Juan RodrÃ­guez Cabrillo in 1542, its first Spanish mission (at San Diego) was not established until 1769. California became a U.S. territory in 1847 when Mexico surrendered it to John C. FrÃ©mont. On Jan. 24, 1848, James W. Marshall discovered gold at Sutter's Mill, starting the California Gold Rush and bringing settlers to the state in large numbers. By 1964, California had surpassed New York to become the most populous state. One reason for this may be that more immigrants settle in California than any other stateâ€”more than one-third of the nation's total in 1994. Asians and Pacific Islanders led the influx."

    description: "Giovanni da Verrazano, an Italian-born navigator sailing for France, discovered New York Bay in 1524. Henry Hudson, an Englishman employed by the Dutch, reached the bay and sailed up the river now bearing his name in 1609, the same year that northern New York was explored and claimed for France by Samuel de Champlain."

    description: "Texas has records of human habitation dating back over eleven thousand years. Located along the Rio Grande, Texas was at the intersection of several major culture groups including the Puebloan peoples, Mississippian peoples, and the Mesoamerican peoples centered around Teotihuacan. By colonial times, there were six major culture groups in Texas, including Comanche, Atakapa, Coahuiltecan, Puebloan, Apachean, and Caddoan peoples (most famously the confederations of the Natchitoches, Hasinai, Wichita, and Caddo). As in many places in colonial history, the interactions between the different cultures of Texas and the colonizing cultures was complex. The name \"Texas\" comes the Hasinai word for \"allies,\" táysha—the Spanish referred to their allies, the Hasinai, as tejas. "

    description: "In 1513, Ponce de LeÃ³n, seeking the mythical â€œFountain of Youth,â€ discovered and named Florida, claiming it for Spain. Later, Florida would be held at different times by Spain and England until Spain finally sold it to the United States in 1819. (Incidentally, France established a colony named Fort Caroline in 1564 in the state that was to become Florida.)"

    description: "Vitus Bering, a Dane working for the Russians, and Alexei Chirikov discovered the Alaskan mainland and the Aleutian Islands in 1741. The tremendous land mass of Alaskaâ€”equal to one-fifth of the continental U.S.â€”was unexplored in 1867 when Secretary of State William Seward arranged for its purchase from the Russians for $7,200,000. The transfer of the territory took place on Oct. 18, 1867. Despite a price of about two cents an acre, the purchase was widely ridiculed as â€œSeward's Folly.â€ The first official census (1880) reported a total of 33,426 Alaskans, all but 430 being of aboriginal stock. The Gold Rush of 1898 resulted in a mass influx of more than 30,000 people. Since then, Alaska has contributed billions of dollars' worth of products to the U.S. economy."
